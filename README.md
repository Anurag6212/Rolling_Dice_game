# Rolling_Dice_game

This is a Rolling-Dice-Game project.
The key features of this project is that we have two players and each player can play dice. 
There will be two box in the UI which is current score and active score. 
Once any player is reaching till 100 points that player will be declared as winner. 
Again both players can play the game with just a simple click.
